There lived a boy named Ram in a village. 
He was a shephard. 
He owned a hundred sheep. 
Every morning Ram took the sheep to graze. 
They grazed in pastures merrily. 
Ram would sit in shade of a big banyan tree.
He would read books. 
He would eat lunch in the afternoon. 
In the evening, he returned home with the sheep. 
Ram was a mischievous boy. 
He got bored on one fine day.
He decided to play a prank. 
It did not go well.
In the afternoon, the farmers working in pastures ate lunch. 
Ram climbed on a tree and began to shout. 
He yelled that a wolf had attacked the sheep. 
the farmers ran towards Ram's voice. 
They arrived at the banyan tree. 
There was no wolf in sight. 
They asked Ram where the wolf was. 
Ram laughed at the farmers. 
He had fooled the farmers. 
He said that there was no wolf.
the farmers scolded Ram. 
They said that no one will help him in real danger. 
They left angrily.
A few days later, he was sleeping under the banyan tree. 
A wolf attacked the sheep. 
He called for help.
He shouted loudly but nobody came for rescue. 
The wolf ate all of the sheep. 
Ram returned home sad.
He learnt a lesson. 
It was that a liar's truth is seldom heard.
