There lived a boy named Ram in a village . Ram was a shephard . Ram owned a hundred sheep . Every morning Ram took the sheep . To graze . the sheep grazed in pastures merrily . Ram would sit in shade of a big banyan tree . Ram would read books . Ram would eat lunch in the afternoon . In the evening Ram returned home with the sheep . Ram was a mischievous boy . Ram got bored on one fine day . Ram decided to play a prank . a prank did not go well . In the afternoon the farmers working in pastures ate lunch . Ram climbed on a tree . Ram began to shout . Ram yelled that a wolf had attacked the sheep . The farmers ran towards Ram 's voice . the sheep arrived at the banyan tree . There was no wolf in sight . the sheep asked Ram . Ram the wolf was . Ram laughed at the farmers . Ram had fooled the farmers . Ram said that there was no wolf . The farmers scolded Ram . the farmers said that no one will help Ram in real danger . the farmers left angrily . A few days later Ram was sleeping under the banyan tree . A wolf attacked the sheep . Ram called for help . Ram shouted loudly . Nobody came for rescue . The wolf ate all of the sheep . Ram returned home sad . Ram learnt a lesson . a lesson was that a liar 's truth is seldom heard .
