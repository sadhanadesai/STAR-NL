There lived a young girl named Belle.
She lived in a small town.
She was a daughter of a craftsman.
The craftsman made machines, toys and furniture.
He was a brilliant artist but a little eccentric.
He made toys and gave to children.
He made furniture and gave furniture to poor.
He lived in a world of imagination.
Belle was a practical girl.
She loved to read books.
She was the most well-read person in the town.
Belle's mother died when she was a baby.
One day the craftsman left to buy goods.
He asked Belle to ask for a gift.
She asked for a rose.
The craftsman promised Belle and left the town.
He travelled back home after a few days.
He was caught in a snowstorm.
He found a castle on the way.
He entered the castle and ate some food.
He saw a rose in the castle.
He picked the rose for Belle.
A beast appeared and threw the craftsman in prison.
